Wellcome APC Shiny App
----------------------

A quick and dirty bit of code to help browse the recently released
Article Processing Charges that the Wellcome Trust paid for in 
2012/2013. http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.963054

This has been built using the Rstudio Shiny package, mostly as a 
learning experience.

Firstly the data was cleaned up with Refine (openrefine.org) in 
order to remove misspellings duplicates or other human-generated
inconsistencies.

The Refine history is included for reproducibility reasons as a
JSON formatted file, 'refine_history.json'.

Installation
------------

Shiny is an R-based app, so you need to have a functioning R
before you can start.

Once you have R, Simply install shiny from CRAN with:

  runGitHub('WellcomeAPCs', 'drchriscole')

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you're on a Mac you may get an error when trying to tun the 
above command. This is due to an odd certificate configuration 
error. Follow the instructions from this link:

You should then be able to use runGitHub directly.
